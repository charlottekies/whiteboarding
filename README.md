# whiteboarding
A repository in which to practice writing, testing, and solving common whiteboarding questions

## Objectives
- Improve whiteboarding skills

## Summary 
The goal is to improve whiteboarding skills in a novel way. Instead of relying upon LeetCode or another commonly-used repository of pre-made algorithm challenges, I have decided to create a bank of coding problems of my own, drawn from publicly-available lists of common whiteboarding interview questions, touching on as many Java-specific Datatypes as possible. Then, before solving them, writing unit tests for each problem. The idea is that if I can improve my ability to imagine edge case scenarios, then I will be able to solve the problems more quickly and efficiently.
