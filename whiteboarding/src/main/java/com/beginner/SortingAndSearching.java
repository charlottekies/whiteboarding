    /** Divide and Conquer Sorting: **/

     // Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort from scratch: These are fundamental sorting algorithms and are suitable for beginners.

    // Implement a sorting algorithm that handles duplicates without changing their relative order: This problem is also beginner-friendly and involves basic sorting logic.



    /** Searching Problems: **/

    /** Linear Search: **/

    // Implement a linear search algorithm to find the first occurrence of an element in an array.

    /** Binary Search: **/

    // Implement a binary search algorithm for a sorted array.

    /** Hashing: **/

    // Create a simple hash table implementation that supports basic operations (insert, search, delete).
