    // String Reversal: Reversing a string is a common introductory problem that can be considered beginner-level.

    // Anagram Detection: Anagram detection, although involving some string manipulation, can be approached at a beginner or intermediate level depending on the complexity of the implementation.

    // Valid Parentheses: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
