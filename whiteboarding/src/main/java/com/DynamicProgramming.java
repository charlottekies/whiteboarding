    // Fibonacci Series.
        // The problem often posed in programming and algorithm challenges is to find the nth Fibonacci number, where n is a non-negative integer.
        // There are various approaches to solving this problem, including recursive algorithms, iterative algorithms, and dynamic programming.
        // Dynamic programming is one of the most efficient ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers as it avoids redundant calculations by storing and reusing intermediate results.
    // Coin Change Problem.
    // Longest Increasing Subsequence.
    // Edit Distance.
    // Knapsack Problem
    // Longest Common Subsequence.
    // Longest Palindromic Subsequence.
    // Matrix Chain Multiplication.
