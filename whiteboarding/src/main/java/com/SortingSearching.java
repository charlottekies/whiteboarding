    /**  Sorting Problems: **/

    // Comparison-Based Sorting:

        // Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort from scratch.

        // Write a sorting algorithm that handles duplicates without changing their relative order.

    // Divide and Conquer Sorting:

        //Implement Merge Sort or Quick Sort.

        //Solve the problem of finding the kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array using a divide-and-conquer approach.

    // Distribution Sorting:

        //Implement Counting Sort or Radix Sort.
        //Write a sorting algorithm that works for custom data types or objects.

    // Hybrid Sorting:

        // Implement Timsort or a custom hybrid sorting algorithm.
        // Write a sorting algorithm that adapts its strategy based on the characteristics of the input data.

    /** Searching Problems: **/

    // Linear Search:

        // Implement a linear search algorithm to find the first occurrence of an element in an array.
        // Solve the problem of finding all occurrences of a specific element in an array.

    // Binary Search:

        // Implement a binary search algorithm for a sorted array.
        // Write a binary search algorithm for a rotated sorted array (search in a rotated array).

    // Hashing:

    // Create a simple hash table implementation that supports basic operations (insert, search, delete).
    // Solve a problem that requires using hashing for efficient data retrieval.

    // Tree-Based Searching:

        // Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) and perform various operations (insertion, deletion, search).
        // Solve a problem that involves balancing a binary search tree (e.g., AVL tree).

    // Graph Searching:

        //Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph traversal.
        //Solve a problem that requires finding a path or shortest path in a graph.

    // Interpolation Search:

        // Implement interpolation search for a dataset with uniformly distributed values.
        // Solve a problem that involves estimating the position of a specific element in a dataset.

    // Exponential Search:

        // Implement exponential search for a dataset with an unknown size.
        // Solve a problem that requires efficient searching in a large, unsorted dataset.

    // String Searching Algorithms:

        // Implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring searching.
        // Solve a problem that involves efficiently searching for patterns within text.
