    /**  Sorting Problems: **/


    // Divide and Conquer Sorting:

        // Solve the problem of finding the kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array using a divide-and-conquer approach.

    /** Distribution Sorting: **/

        // Write a sorting algorithm that works for custom data types or objects.

    /** Hybrid Sorting: **/

        // Implement Timsort or a custom hybrid sorting algorithm.

        // Write a sorting algorithm that adapts its strategy based on the characteristics of the input data.

    /** Searching Problems: **/


    /** Tree-Based Searching: **/

    // Solve a problem that involves balancing a binary search tree (e.g., AVL tree).

    /** Graph Searching: **/

    // Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph traversal.
    // Solve a problem that requires finding a path or shortest path in a graph.

    /** Interpolation Search: **/

    // Solve a problem that involves estimating the position of a specific element in a dataset.

    /** Exponential Search: **/

    // Solve a problem that requires efficient searching in a large, unsorted dataset.

    /** String Searching Algorithms: **/

    // Implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring searching.
    // Solve a problem that involves efficiently searching for patterns within text.
